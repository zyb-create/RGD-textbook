@article{Ho2019a,
	abstract = {An in-depth understanding of gas transport in ultra-tight porous media is the key to quantifying flow properties of shale rocks with pore space as small as a few nanometers, where the gas rarefaction effects play a major role. As the conventional fluid mechanics theory fails to describe non-equilibrium rarefied flow, we resort to the gas kinetic theory and directly simulate gas flow inside the porous media utilising the digital images of porous media where the pore space is resolved. The Boltzmann model equation is solved by the discrete velocity method (DVM), which can accurately predict the permeability enhancement caused by rarefaction effects. Our simulations for different porous media show that the commonly-used standard lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) cannot describe rarefaction effects, although the kinetic boundary condition, which helps to capture velocity-slip, can extend the validity of the LBM to the slip flow regime. The heuristic Klinkenberg-type models proposed for all the flow regimes often involve many unknown empirical parameters, which may be calibrated by our simulations. However, these parameters are different for each porous medium and also depend on flow conditions, so these models are not of any practical use. By contrast, our kinetic solver can accurately predict apparent permeability without introducing any empirical parameters, which lays firm foundation for upscaling. As the large flow paths with least flow resistance dominate the overall permeability, the requirement on the velocity-space resolution is significantly reduced for our DVM simulations to predict accurate permeability with affordable computational costs, which offers a promising new way for digital rock analysis.},

@article{Germanou2018,
	abstract = {Accurate prediction of unconventional gas production requires deep understanding of the permeability of complex rock samples. Several predictive expressions of permeability, which include either simplifications of the porous media structure or the flow mechanisms, have been proposed recently. The main objective of this research is to quantify the impact of solid matrix complexity on both intrinsic and apparent permeability. To this end, numerous two-dimensional random porous media structures are constructed using the quartet structure generation set algorithm. Parametric and statistical analysis reveals the importance of the specific surface area of pores, tortuosity, heterogeneity and degree of anisotropy. Special focus is given to the directional dependency of the permeability on isotropic and anisotropic geometries, considering the great impact of anisotropy on the laboratory evaluation of permeability data and the anisotropic nature of shale rocks. Simulation results, for the same value of porosity, clearly indicate the drastic improvement of permeability due to the reduction of specific surface area of pores and their height to width ratio. This suggests that rock matrix complexity has significant impact on permeability and should not be neglected while forming permeability formulations for porous media. Finally, the results of the apparent permeability, obtained by solving the gas kinetic equation, are taken into consideration to demonstrate the enhancement ratio, slip factor and their correlation with the aforementioned parameters. Semi-analytical expressions for intrinsic and apparent permeability, considering continuum and slip flow respectively, are derived. The proposed formulations, suitable for both isotropic and anisotropic structures, have the advantage of not entailing any numerical or experimental data as input.},

@article{Mokhtari2015,
	abstract = {Accurate determination of permeability is essential and challenging in organic-rich shales due to the tight and heterogeneous nature of shale formations, the presence of lamination as well as induced or natural fractures and the sensitivity of fracture permeability to stress. The tight nature of shale formation makes the traditional steady-state method not to be practical. Therefore, unsteady state methods such as pulse decay or crushed-sample have been practiced for shales. However, the pulse decay method can be still time consuming and the crushed-sample method is size-dependent as our numerical simulations show. As an alternative method, the results of complex transient method are presented. Moreover, the presence of lamination and fractures causes directional dependency of permeability. To characterize this type of anisotropy, three-plug method is usually applied. However, the variation of permeability with location causes this method to be unreliable in heterogeneous formations. Similarly, the presence of artificial micro-fractures affects the reliability of the permeability measurement in shales. Using variety of methods to measure permeability, the effects of these anisotropic and heterogeneous features under stress are discussed.},

@article{Wang2016,
	abstract = {One main challenge for prediction of gas permeability in shale is the geometrical complexity at pore scale of shale. Shale structure is highly anisotropic and heterogeneous, which cannot be well described by packing of spheres or bundle of tubes. Besides, there are abundant nanoscale pores in shale so that the Knudsen number of gas flow is high, leading to failure of the conventional Darcy's law. Aiming at these challenges, we have studied the influences from pore-scale anisotropy and heterogeneity of shale microstructures on gas permeability including the high Knudsen number effect (or Klinkenberg effect for Darcy scale). First, a geometry-based method is proposed to quantify the pore-scale anisotropy and heterogeneity of shale. Then we reconstruct three-dimensional shale structures by the random generation-growth algorithm and use the lattice Boltzmann method to predict its permeability. To reveal the high Knudsen number effect, both intrinsic permeability and apparent permeability are evaluated. Our results suggest that the intrinsic permeability increases with the anisotropy of pore geometry in parallel direction to the bed, while decreases in perpendicular direction. The slip factor for Klinkenberg correction also exhibits anisotropy when high Knudsen effect is considered. On the other hand, the heterogeneity of pore distribution may have positive influences on intrinsic permeability for given porosities.},
